# Week 1 day 3 - Git Workflows
##Assignment Overview

This assignment will build upon basic Git knowledge and illustrate a full Git workflow, much like workflows used in production environments. 

**You will:**

  - Fork this repository, which contains an HTML file and empty markdown file. The fork is like a clone, in that it is a copy of the existing repository, except that you can contribute back to the original project, rather than only having a local copy of the code. 
  - Create a new branch named "readme". This is what is called a "feature branch" and is used to work on features without impacting the main branch.
  - Checkout the "readme" branch. 
  - Add a new JavaScript file and a new CSS file.
  - Edit the HTML file to include your new files.
  - Fill out the markdown document to explain that this is a basic HTML template, write at least one example on how to use it, add your contact information, and add a [software license of your choice](http://choosealicense.com/).
  - Once you're completely finished with the assignment, merge your branch back into the master branch of your repository to signal that the "feature" is complete.
  - Submit a pull request to the original repo.
  
####Be sure to commit your changes to your development branch frequently!
